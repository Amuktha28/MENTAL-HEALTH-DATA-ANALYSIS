# gst
This project involves building a predictive model using GST (Goods and Services Tax) data to predict the target variable based on input features. The dataset provided is preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and scaling. The model used is a Random Forest Classifier.
# Key Methodology
Data-oriented approach (recommended by Andrew Ng, Stanford CS Professor):

# 1. Handling Imbalanced Data with SMOTE:
The dataset had an imbalanced target variable. To avoid bias towards the majority class, SMOTE was applied to generate synthetic instances for the minority class, balancing the class distribution and improving model fairness in predictions.

# 2. Model Selection: 
RandomForestClassifier: The RandomForestClassifier from sklearn was chosen for its ability to handle both linear and non-linear data distributions. As an ensemble method, RandomForest provides robust predictions by combining the results of multiple decision trees.
n_estimators=100: 
The number of decision trees in the forest.
max_depth=None: No limit was set for the depth of trees, allowing the model to capture complex interactions.
Random state=42: Ensured reproducibility of the results.
# 3. Training and Validation:
The data was preprocessed, balanced using SMOTE, and then split into training and testing sets. The model was trained on the training data, and hyperparameters were optimized to achieve the best balance between training time and model accuracy.

# 4. Evaluation Metrics: Model performance was evaluated using multiple metrics:

Accuracy: Measured overall correctness of predictions.
Precision: Focused on the proportion of true positive predictions.
Recall: Assessed how many of the actual positives were identified correctly.
F1 Score: A balanced measure combining both precision and recall.
AUC-ROC: Indicated the model's ability to discriminate between the two classes, with a higher value demonstrating better performance.
# 5.Confusion Matrix: 
The confusion matrix gave a granular view of the classification performance:
True Negatives (TN): Correctly classified negative cases.
False Positives (FP): Incorrectly classified positive cases.
False Negatives (FN): Positive cases missed by the model.
True Positives (TP): Correctly classified positive cases.
Conclusion: By applying SMOTE to handle class imbalance and utilizing the RandomForestClassifier, the model achieved a balance of precision and recall, with good accuracy across the key metrics.
